<Intro>

Welcome to **My Nikki** — a personal log of thoughts, progress, and life updates.  
This is where I share milestones, reflections, and moments that matter.

You won’t find release notes here, but you might catch glimpses of projects, daily logs, and personal insights.  
If you follow along, you’ll see the journey unfold — one entry at a time.
