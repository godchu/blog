At least she replied today.

Every reason she gave makes sense, and honestly, I don’t even know how to put my feelings into words for her to understand. It feels like I’m doing everything I can to hold on to this connection.

The one positive thing in what felt like a bad day: she agreed we could still be friends.

Funny how just a few words can lift my mood like that.

Maybe it’s time to start over again—from scratch, from being strangers who just say hello.

_"Also… should I play badminton tomorrow?"_
